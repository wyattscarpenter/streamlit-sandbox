# Streamlit Sandbox (st-sandbox)

A sandbox for interactive streamlit execution. Need I say more? Yes? Well, too bad.

https://st-sandbox.streamlit.app

This project is set to use python 3.12.

This project is completely finished because it's a very simple concept. A more fully-featured streamlit sandbox can be found at https://samdobson-streamlit-sandbox-app-za85j0.streamlit.app/
